# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of the website (`main` branch) is actively maintained.  
No legacy versions are supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Although this is a static personal portfolio site with limited attack surface, I take security seriously.

If you discover a potential security issue â€” for example:
- Vulnerabilities in the contact form (e.g. spam abuse, data leakage)
- Misconfigured deployment exposing sensitive data
- Insecure dependencies in the frontend bundle

Please **do not open a public issue**. Instead, contact me directly:

ðŸ“§ **Email**: [alyreniko@gmail.com](mailto:alyreniko@gmail.com)  
ðŸ’¬ **Telegram**: [@alyreniko](https://t.me/alyreniko)

## Scope

This policy covers:
- The live website: https://alyreniko.page
- The source code in this repository
- The contact form integration (Google Apps Script endpoint)

It does **not** cover:
- Third-party services (GitHub, Google, etc.)
- Browser-specific exploits unrelated to this siteâ€™s code

Thank you for helping keep this project secure!
